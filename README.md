# investigate_a_dataset
### In this project, I performed analysis on a dataset about the information of over 100 thousand patients who has medical appointment, collected from a hospital in Brazil.

I was able to investigate and depict some factors that affects the showing up of patients for their appointments with doctors, which in turn will help predicting the amount of patients that are likely to show up if some factors are put in place.
